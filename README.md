# installation_script
My personal installation script for setting up an Ubuntu based Linux distribution (only tested with Pop!_OS).

Although running installation_script.py will call all configuration scripts automatically, each configure_*.py file is intended to be runnable independently. This will allow for i.e. reconfiguring a program if it reinstalled, without affecting the rest of the system.
